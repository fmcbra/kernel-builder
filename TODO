TODO
================================================================================

01. Go through all places where variables are passed to functions/programs and
    ensure that all those that should be double-quoted are.  These are primarily
    variables which come from kernel-builder.conf (/etc/default/kernel-builder).

02. Document options better.  Currently all/most options are at least visible
    from "kernel-builder --help" but lack helpful descriptions.
